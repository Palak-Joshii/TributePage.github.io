<h2>Top learning lessons from the billionaire.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Train Yourself To Find & Seize Opportunities Constantly</b></li>
    Gautam Adani has portrayed this ability throughout his career. For instance, he realised how essential ports are for trade, and there was space for him to get into this business. So, he took the opportunity and eventually established a monopoly on seaports. 

Even when he was young, he saw the scope in diamonds, ran a diamond trading business for a while, and became a millionaire when he was just 20.

He understands the market and economy very well. That's why whenever there's a change in the market or economy, he quickly seizes the opportunities in it.
<br>
<br>
<li>
   <b> Negotiation & Sales Skills Are A Must.</b>
</li>Gautam Adani is known for his sales skills. Once, when he visited the then railway minister, Nitish Kumar, he successfully persuaded him to see the importance of integrating ports into the railways and how it will benefit the country and the port owners.

This led to the formulation of the first national port-rail linkage policy. Because of this, the ports could link their terminals to the national highway grid and run their railway line to the nearest railheads.

Effective skills come in handy if you want to succeed in any aspect of your life, be it business, job, or even relationships. It is a tool that, if acquired, can give you immense benefits in life.
<br><br>
<li>
   <b>Payback To Society & Remember Your Values</b>
</li>
If you want to be successful, stick to your value system, and give back to society whenever possible. Adani is a man of an unbending attitude and strong ethics. This system is what keeps you on the right track when the wrong ways seem to lure you.

Adani is involved in many philanthropic activities with his wife through his foundation. Recently, Adani and his family even pledged to donate ₹60,000 crores for social causes. Adani firmly believes in his core philosophy of infusing "Growth with Goodness".
<br><br>
<li>
  <b>Learn To Stay Young</b>
</li>
Adani never went to any big business school to study; he even dropped out of college. Instead, he learned by interacting with people, constantly observing the market or trade tricks, and making mistakes.

Yes, mistakes are one of the best ways to learn. This learning mindset gave him whatever he has today. 

Whatever you do in your life, you should always keep learning because it keeps you humble, prepares you for better opportunities, broadens your perspective, and eventually skyrockets your growth. It's real wealth.
<br><br>
<li>
<b>Diversification Is The Secret Ingredient.</b>
</li>
Adani knew that diversification was necessary, and it will give him immense growth. That's why he diversified his business according to the market situation. 

He started by exporting agricultural and power products but built businesses ranging from oil and gas exploration, power generation and distribution, logistics, and port development. He is also one of the most prominent green energy players.
